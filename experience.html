		<h2>Experience</h2>
		<p>My web design experience began several years ago when I was serving in the United States Navy. For the first two years of my enlistment I was living in Cornwall, which makes up one third of the island of England. Specifically I was on the southwestern tip of the island living in a town called Newquay. It was here where I unintentionally became the command webmaster of my first duty station. I had zero prior knowledge of web coding languages and relied solely on a program called Microsoft Frontpage to code for me. When I eventually left England, my foray into the world of web design came to an end. Little did a know, years later, I would become enamoured with the wonders of web coding. </p>
		<p>For several years after, up until this very day, I dabbled in HTNL, CSS, JavaScript, and some PHP but never really took it seriously as a career path. It wasn't until I found Treehouse that becoming a web developer seeemed like a potential reality for me. I have pursued many things in my professional life including becoming a chef, digital marketing, and even getting a degree in Criminal Justice. All but one of those things, specifically the degree, ever quite panned out for me. Its my hope that, with the assistance of Team Treehouse, I can grow my knowledge significantly enough to jump into the web developer world and make it the career I spend my life building.</p>
