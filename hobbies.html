		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<p>In my life I have had many hobbies but only one has stood the test of time...woodworking. My love for this craft started during a slew of renovations my parents were doing to there home. Being that I was a strapping young teenager at the time I was quickly put to work. I helped with many projects from painting to building a complete addition on the house. I assisted with many projects during that time but the ones I enjoyed the most involved woodworking. Over that years I learned many things about the craft and acquired a bunch of tools. I now have a complete woodworking hobby shop in my garage. Below are a few pictures of things I have made.</p>
